# PlayLister

Got tired of manually going through my Clone Hero game folders to remove songs or readd songs.
created this little python program to allow me to on the fly while playing to just remove or readd songs.
Also helped with learning process of more python/tkinter.


Project is in 2 formats

Original was GUI and program logic in 1 file. Which is PlaylisterV1.pyw.
Think there may still be some bugs I fixed in the new format. Otherwise the 2 formats do the same things

New format seperates the GUI information and setup from the program logic.

LogFile.py - program logic
UiFile.py  - tkinter GUI setup

Just did it to see how to do that and to not have a bunch of code cluttering up the file when just working
on the program logic.
